# QultureRocks Front-end Challenge

This challenge is built using React, under [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/next/README.md) boilerplate.

# Running the project locally

The last command will start the server on the local URL: http://localhost:3000/

# Running the project on CodeSandbox
